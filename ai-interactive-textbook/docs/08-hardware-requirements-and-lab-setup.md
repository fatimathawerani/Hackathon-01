# Hardware Requirements and Lab Setup


## The Compute Brain
For Physical AI, we need edge computing capable of running neural networks.
*   **Primary:** NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano or AGX Orin.
*   **Alternative:** Raspberry Pi 5 (for low-level control only, not heavy AI).

## Sensors
1.  **LiDAR:** For 2D/3D mapping (e.g., RPLidar).
2.  **Depth Cameras:** RGB-D cameras (e.g., Intel RealSense, OAK-D) for point clouds.
3.  **IMU:** Accelerometer and Gyroscope for balance.

## Actuators
*   **Servo Motors:** Dynamixel or similar smart servos providing position feedback.
*   **BLDC Motors:** High torque motors for humanoid legs, often used with harmonic drives.

## Power
*   **LiPo / Li-Ion Batteries:** High discharge rates required.
*   **BMS:** Battery Management Systems to prevent fires. -->
