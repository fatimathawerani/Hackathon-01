# Welcome to Your AI Interactive Textbook

## Overview of Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

### Welcome to the Future of Embodied Intelligence

Welcome to the **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics** textbook. This course is designed to bridge the gap between digital artificial intelligence (LLMs, Computer Vision) and physical actuation.

We are moving from the era of **chatbots** to **task-bots** — intelligent agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting in the physical world.

## Course Objectives

By the end of this book, you will be able to:

1. **Define Physical AI**  
   Understand the convergence of robotics, mechanics, and advanced AI models.

2. **Master ROS 2**  
   Navigate the Robot Operating System (ROS 2) ecosystem.

3. **Simulate Environments**  
   Use Gazebo and NVIDIA Isaac Sim to create digital twins.

4. **Control Humanoids**  
   Understand kinematics and dynamics for bipedal locomotion.

5. **Integrate LLMs**  
   Connect conversational AI agents to robotic hardware.

## Prerequisites

- **Programming:** Python and C++
- **OS:** Linux (Ubuntu)
- **Math:** Linear Algebra & Physics

## The “AI-Native” Approach

This course prioritizes data-driven AI, reinforcement learning, and foundation models over traditional control-first robotics.
