# Overview of Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics


## Welcome to the Future of Embodied Intelligence

Welcome to the **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics** textbook. This course is designed to bridge the gap between digital artificial intelligence (LLMs, Computer Vision) and physical actuation. We are moving from the era of "Chatbots" to "Task-bots"—intelligent agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting in the physical world.

## Course Objectives

By the end of this book, you will be able to:
1.  **Define Physical AI:** Understand the convergence of robotics, mechanics, and advanced AI models.
2.  **Master ROS 2:** Navigate the Robot Operating System (ROS 2) ecosystem for middleware communication.
3.  **Simulate Environments:** Use Gazebo and NVIDIA Isaac Sim to create Digital Twins.
4.  **Control Humanoids:** Understand the kinematics and dynamics required for bipedal locomotion.
5.  **Integrate LLMs:** Connect conversational AI agents to robotic hardware for natural interaction.

## Prerequisites
*   **Programming:** Proficiency in Python and C++.
*   **OS:** Basic familiarity with Linux (Ubuntu).
*   **Math:** Linear Algebra and basic Physics.

## The "AI-Native" Approach
Unlike traditional robotics courses that focus heavily on control theory first, this course is **AI-Native**. We prioritize learning how to use data-driven approaches, reinforcement learning, and pre-trained foundation models to solve robotic challenges.-->
