# Capstone: Building the Autonomous Humanoid


## Project Brief
Students will work in teams to program a humanoid robot (simulated or physical) to perform a "Search and Rescue" or "Service" task.

## The Mission
The robot starts at Point A. It must:
1.  **Navigate** to a kitchen area using SLAM.
2.  **Identify** a specific object (e.g., a blue cup) using Vision AI.
3.  **Grasp** the object (or tag it in simulation).
4.  **Return** to the user and announce completion via Voice.

## Rubric
*   **30% ROS 2 Architecture:** Clean nodes, proper topics, custom interfaces.
*   **30% AI Implementation:** Accuracy of object detection and navigation.
*   **20% Simulation:** Quality of the Digital Twin environment.
*   **20% Documentation:** Quality of the final report and video demo.

## Submission
Submit a GitHub repository link containing the ROS 2 workspace, the trained model weights, and a Readme file explaining how to launch the demo. -->
