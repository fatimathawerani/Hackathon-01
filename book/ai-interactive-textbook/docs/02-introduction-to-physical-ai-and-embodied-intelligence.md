# Introduction to Physical AI and Embodied Intelligence


## What is Physical AI?
Physical AI refers to the use of Artificial Intelligence techniques to solve problems that involve interaction with the physical world. While Generative AI deals with text and images, Physical AI deals with **dynamics, gravity, collision, and actuation**.

## The Three Pillars
1.  **Perception:** Understanding the environment using cameras, LiDAR, and IMUs.
2.  **Reasoning:** Using AI models (like VLA - Vision Language Action models) to decide *what* to do.
3.  **Actuation:** Converting decisions into motor commands (torques and velocities).

## Embodied Intelligence
"Embodiment" is the hypothesis that intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent and its environment. A brain in a jar cannot be fully intelligent; it must interact with the world to understand concepts like "heavy," "slippery," or "fragile."

## Current Landscape
*   **Traditional Robotics:** Hard-coded logic, strict state machines.
*   **Modern Physical AI:** End-to-end neural networks, Imitation Learning, and Sim-to-Real transfer. -->
