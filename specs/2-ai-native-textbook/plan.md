# Implementation Plan: AI-Native Interactive Textbook

**Branch**: `2-ai-native-textbook` | **Date**: 2025-12-10 | **Spec**: [specs/2-ai-native-textbook/spec.md](specs/2-ai-native-textbook/spec.md)
**Input**: Create a development plan for building with a book in docusaurus include: 1. Docusaurus setup steps and configuration 2. Content development phases 3. File structure for chapters and lessons

## Summary

This plan outlines the development process for creating an interactive textbook using Docusaurus. It covers the initial setup and configuration of the Docusaurus project, a phased approach for content development, and a detailed file structure to organize chapters and lessons for maintainability and scalability.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Markdown, TypeScript, React
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus, Node.js, npm/yarn
**Storage**: Local file system (Git repository)
**Testing**: Manual verification of Docusaurus build and site navigation.
**Target Platform**: Web (static site)
**Project Type**: Single project (Docusaurus application)
**Performance Goals**: Fast page loads, handled by Docusaurus static site generation.
**Constraints**: The file structure must be compatible with Docusaurus's autogenerated sidebars.
**Scale/Scope**: A multi-chapter book with multiple lessons per chapter.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [x] **I. Code Quality**: All configurations will follow Docusaurus best practices.
- [x] **II. Content Consistency**: The proposed file structure and content development phases enforce consistency.
- [ ] **III. Rigorous Testing**: Manual testing is planned. Automated testing is deferred.
- [ ] **IV. Chatbot Reliability and Accuracy**: N/A
- [x] **V. Performance Optimization**: Handled by Docusaurus's static site generation.
- [x] **VI. Accessibility**: Docusaurus provides a strong accessibility foundation.
- [x] **VII. User Experience Consistency**: A consistent navigation structure is a core part of this plan.
- [x] **VIII. Comprehensive Documentation**: This plan itself serves as key documentation.

## Docusaurus Setup Steps and Configuration

1.  **Initialize Docusaurus Project**: Use the command `npm init docusaurus@latest` to scaffold a new Docusaurus site (if not already done).
2.  **Configure `docusaurus.config.ts`**:
    *   Set the `title`, `url`, `baseUrl`, and `organizationName`/`projectName`.
    *   Configure the `presets` section, specifically for `@docusaurus/preset-classic`, to enable docs.
3.  **Configure `sidebars.ts`**:
    *   Create the `sidebars.ts` file in the project root.
    *   Configure it to use the autogenerated sidebar feature to automatically build the navigation from the `docs` directory structure. The key configuration is `tutorialSidebar: [{type: 'autogenerated', dirName: '.'}]`.

## Content Development Phases

1.  **Phase 1: Structure Scaffolding (This Feature)**
    *   Create the chapter and lesson directory structure as defined in the "Project Structure" section below.
    *   Create placeholder Markdown files (`.md`) for each lesson.
    *   Each file will contain a frontmatter title and a "TODO" comment for content.
2.  **Phase 2: Initial Content Draft**
    *   Populate each lesson's Markdown file with the initial draft of the content, including text, images, and code snippets.
3.  **Phase 3: Review and Refinement**
    *   Review the drafted content for technical accuracy, clarity, and consistency.
    *   Refine the content based on feedback.
4.  **Phase 4: Advanced Features (Future Scope)**
    *   Integrate interactive components, quizzes, or other Docusaurus features as needed.

## Project Structure

### File Structure for Chapters and Lessons

To create a clean, hierarchical navigation structure with chapters and lessons, the following file organization will be used within the `docs` directory.

```text
ai-interactive-textbook/
└── docs/
    ├── 01-chapter-one/
    │   ├── _category_.json   // Defines the label for the chapter in the sidebar
    │   ├── 01-lesson-one.md
    │   └── 02-lesson-two.md
    ├── 02-chapter-two/
    │   ├── _category_.json
    │   ├── 01-lesson-one.md
    │   └── 02-lesson-two.md
    └── intro.md              // The landing page for the documentation
```

**Structure Rationale**:
*   **Numbered Directories**: Numbering the chapter folders (`01-chapter-one`) ensures they are ordered correctly in the sidebar.
*   **`_category_.json`**: This special Docusaurus file is used to give the directory a custom label in the sidebar (e.g., "Chapter 1: Getting Started") and control its position.
*   **Numbered Lesson Files**: Numbering the lesson files (`01-lesson-one.md`) ensures they appear in the correct order within each chapter.

## Complexity Tracking

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| III. Rigorous Testing | For the initial content scaffolding and setup, manual verification of the build and navigation is faster and sufficient. | Setting up automated testing for file structure and static content provides low ROI at this early stage. It will be considered when interactive components are added. |
