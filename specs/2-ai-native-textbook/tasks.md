# Tasks: AI-Native Interactive Textbook

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/2-ai-native-textbook/`

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by phase to ensure a logical and incremental build process.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Phase 1: Docusaurus Setup & Configuration

**Purpose**: Ensure the Docusaurus project is correctly configured to support the book structure.

- [ ] T001 [P] Configure `docusaurus.config.ts` with the correct book title, URL, and other metadata.
- [ ] T002 [P] Create and configure `sidebars.ts` to use autogenerated sidebars from the `docs` directory.
- [ ] T003 Create the main `intro.md` file in `ai-interactive-textbook/docs/` to serve as the book's landing page.

## Phase 2: Chapter 1 Scaffolding

**Purpose**: Create the file structure and placeholder content for the first chapter and its lessons.

- [ ] T004 [P] Create the directory for Chapter 1 at `ai-interactive-textbook/docs/01-introduction-to-physical-ai/`.
- [ ] T005 [P] Create the category definition file `_category_.json` inside `ai-interactive-textbook/docs/01-introduction-to-physical-ai/`.
- [ ] T006 [P] Create the placeholder file for Lesson 1 at `ai-interactive-textbook/docs/01-introduction-to-physical-ai/01-what-is-physical-ai.md`.
- [ ] T007 [P] Create the placeholder file for Lesson 2 at `ai-interactive-textbook/docs/01-introduction-to-physical-ai/02-embodied-intelligence.md`.
- [ ] T008 [P] Create the placeholder file for Lesson 3 at `ai-interactive-textbook/docs/01-introduction-to-physical-ai/03-history-and-future.md`.

## Phase 3: Validation and Verification

**Purpose**: Build the site and manually verify that the setup and scaffolding are correct.

- [ ] T009 Run the Docusaurus build command (`npm run build`) inside the `ai-interactive-textbook/` directory to ensure there are no errors.
- [ ] T010 Start the development server (`npm start`) inside the `ai-interactive-textbook/` directory.
- [ ] T011 Manually verify that the book's introduction page, Chapter 1, and its three lessons appear correctly in the sidebar and are navigable.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: Can start immediately. Tasks T001-T003 can run in parallel.
- **Phase 2 (Scaffolding)**: Depends on Phase 1 completion. Tasks T004-T008 can run in parallel.
- **Phase 3 (Validation)**: Depends on Phase 2 completion. Tasks must run sequentially (T009 → T010 → T011).

### Implementation Strategy

This plan follows an incremental approach:
1.  **Setup First**: Configure the core Docusaurus application.
2.  **Scaffold Content**: Build out the structure for the first chapter.
3.  **Validate**: Immediately test the changes by building and serving the site to ensure the structure is correct before proceeding with further content.
